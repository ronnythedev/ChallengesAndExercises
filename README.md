# Algorithms and Data Structure Exercises in C#

### My current approach:

1. Follow Grokking's patterns and exercises.
2. Make them in LeetCode.
3. Make them again in C# with Unit Tests.
4. Once I feel comfortable with the pattern, make as much exercises as I can in LeetCode filtering by pattern.
5. Do them again in this project.
